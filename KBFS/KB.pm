# This  is a  cool  system  for storing  facts.   Basically, I  became
# excessively worried about how to  manage all of the state stuff that
# I need  to.  I  can definitely write  something, whereas  I wouldn't
# know what  to look for otherwise.   So I will  risk reimplementing a
# system, since  we can  expect to find  it later.   Adaptation should
# never be difficult - though that might be a naive observation.
