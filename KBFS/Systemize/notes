We want to do a few things here:

We want to  be able to look at  the contents of the file.  If  it is a
document, we  want to get the  text out and  try to find out  what the
text is about.

We can use soft clustering against existing documents.

We also want to run "plagerism" detection software to see whether this
file is related, either a  copy, derivative, remix, etc, of an earlier
work or works.

Maybe even do TDT.
