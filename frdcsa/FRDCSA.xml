    KBFS stands for knowledge based file system.  It is wrong to call it a
    file  system,  but it  has  a  lot of  features,  and  maybe could  be
    eventually made into a virtual file system.

    Pack is  a subsystem for packing  files onto DVDs.  Mainly  this is an
    exercise for  me in Object Oriented  Perl programming.  Its  a fun and
    manageable domain.  The goal is to efficienty and orderly pack a given
    media with the right directories.

    Print nice labels, with barcodes for CD's/DVD's based on contents, for
    reminders and correlation with the media relations part of KBFS.
