# this system attempts to categorize files, it's like file, but also suggests a place for things.

# rules

# check  to see  whether the  directory is  not part  of a  package or
# something like that, whether it  doesn't belong there.  get an image
# for what is out of place.  for this reason, the system ought to know
# all the basic things, like the purpose of the FHS, etc. 

# if its a perl script, if we wrote it, try to find a system to which
# it belongs, otherwise put it in a collection center for rogue perl
# scripts also check for related files nearby, such as data file, Perl
# Modules, etc.

# if its a document, it may be a manual for a system, it may be a political paper

# images might be logos for projects, items that we wish to buy, pornography

# if it is a plain text file, it could be a set of notes

# if it is  a directory, it might be an  errant problem, especially if
# its in a home directory

# look at the contents and try to determine related topics based on a
# topical model



# Political action items

# Political coordination
